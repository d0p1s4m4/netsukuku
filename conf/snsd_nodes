#                       SNSD nodes file
#
# List, one per line, the SNSD records you want register in ANDNA.
#
# You can register up to 255 records and you can associate a maximum of 16
# records to a service.
#
# Each line must be in the following format:
#
#	hostname:snsd_hostname:service:priority:weight[:pub_key_file]
# or
# 	hostname:snsd_ip:service:priority:weight[:pub_key_file]
#
#
# The `pub_key_file' parameter is optional. If you specify it, NetsukukuD will
# challenge periodically `snsd_hostname' and it will verify if it is always the
# same machine. If it isn't, the relative snsd will be deleted.
#
# `hostname' must be one of the hostnames listed in the andna_hostnames file.
#
# `snsd_hostname' is the hostname of the snsd_node. `snsd_ip' is, instead, its
# ip. 
#
# `service' specifies the service of the snsd record. It is one of the
# service listed in /etc/services. It can be expressed also in numeric form.
# It is also possible to specify the protocol, f.e: 
# 	"domain", "53", "53/udp", "domain/udp"
# are valid service strings.
#
# `priority' is an integer between 0 and 255, it specifies the "backup"
# priority of the snsd record.
#
# `weight' is an integer between 0 and 12, it specifies the "load balancing"
# weight of the snsd record.
#
# --
#
# The main IP associated to a normal hostname has these default values:
#	IP	 = register_node IP	# This value can't be changed
#	service  = 0
#	priority = 16
#	weight   = 1
# If you want to modify the paremeters of the mainip use this syntax:
#	hostname:hostname:0:priority:weight
# Only one line with this syntax is allowed, duplicates will be ignored.
